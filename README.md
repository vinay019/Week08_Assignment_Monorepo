## User stories:

**Web Fundamentals:**

🐿️ As a Developer, I want to set up a ‘monorepo’ project with a client and server folder, so that I can manage and separate my code.

🐿️ As a Developer, I want to deploy both my client and server code to Render.

**Programming Logic:**

🐿️ As a Developer, I should have at least one GET route on my server which returns data.

🐿️ As a Developer, I should make sure my client can interact with server and also display the data from my server.

🐿️ As a User, I should be able to interact with the web page and see some kind of result from my interactions.

**Stretch User Stories**

**Web Fundamentals:**

🐿️ As a Developer, I should ensure that the app looks great on multiple screen sizes and the design/style changes meaningfully depending on that.

🐿️ As a User, I should find the app engaging/meaningful/useful in some way, so that I’m encouraged to visit and use it.

🐿️ As a Developer, I should plan my app with excellence, so that my understanding of what I’m creating is stronger and so I can demonstrate it to others.

**Programming Logic:**

🐿️ As a Developer, I should write DRY code so that my app is easier to maintain.

🐿️ As a User, I can interact in multiple ways with the app to get different results.

🐿️ As a Developer, I have integrated an API with my server, to give the app enhanced functionality.
